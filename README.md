# VirtualVoiceAssisstant
This project is a real-time AI-powered voice assistant built using the ElevenLabs Conversational AI API . It allows you to interact with an assistant naturally through speech. The assistant listens to your voice, processes the input with an LLM, generates context-aware responses, and replies back using natural-sounding speech.
